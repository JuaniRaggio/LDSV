= What Architecture to use?

MVC - Model View Controller is an Industry standard model for building
user interfaces, so we _don't have to think_ of a complex architecture.

Do it staightforward

= Model-Architecture

The idea is having interfaces who define what we should be overriding
to have a "visual" data structure.

I will try doing it Generic and as an example, there will be a sample
using ints
