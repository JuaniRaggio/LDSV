_Live Data Structure Visiualizer_

== Idea

- Data structure visualizer so its easier to understand the thought process for each algorithm on each data structure

== Use

- Each data structure will require you to implement an interface, this interface will be the one used to show your data structure

- The interface should require as minimum as posible

== Objective

- Practice data structures as deep as possible (Including complex algoritms)

- Build a book-like documentation to learn Data Structures and Algorithms

- Make a usefull high level library to show students how data structures work

- Practice 2D graphics

- Not yet decided where to develop it but the idea is building it on C++
